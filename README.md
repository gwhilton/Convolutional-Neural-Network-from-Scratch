# Convolutional-Neural-Network-from-Scratch
The CNN I created in Machine-Learning-Project-2

Contains the code used to build and train a CNN. It provides probability based predictions for each class as well as training/validation accuracy and loss.

I use a tanh activation function between layers and softmax on the final layer - to make the prediction. I use a cross entropy loss function and stochastic gradient descent.

I shuffle the batches on each epoch as although it takes longer it prevents the network learning the specific batches.

For a quick example of its capabilities see the html file in Machine-Learning-Project-2.
